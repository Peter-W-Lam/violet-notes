# Violet Notes
This project is hosted [here on Github Pages](http://peterlam.me/violet-notes/#/)
## Overview
This project is an extension of [this Dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/3603745-Notes-screen) by Valeria Rimkevich. Added to the original design of the dashboard for the overall notes are screens for authentication (logging in, signing up, resetting a password), and for an editor for the notes themselves. Additional screens were designed by me in Sketch, and then implemented in React. 
## Technologies Used
* React.js 
* CSS & CSS Variables
## Components Implemented
This project implements the front-end interface of the notes portion of a multi-function web application. It leaves room for the back-end of this application to be implemented at a later date, potentially by Node.js and ExpressJS.  Additionally, menus on this applicationâ€™s sidebar are solely decorative, in order to conform to the original design.
